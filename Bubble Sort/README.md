# Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort works by:
1. Start with the first element index = 0 and compares the current element with the next element of the array.
2. If the current element is greater than the next element of the array swap them.
3. If the current element is less than the next element move to the next element **Repeat step 1**

### Output
Unsorted Array: <br />
5 1 6 2 4 3 <br />
Sorted Array: <br/>
1 2 3 4 5 6
